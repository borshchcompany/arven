Accountant Helper

## Node installation
Go to [Node download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install Node for your OS

## Clone repository
If not installed install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your OS

After installation go to the directory where you want to keep your files e.g. **D:\projects\\** and open cmd.
To do that you need to hold **Shift + Right Click** in the folder you want it opened on, and click "open command window here". That should do the trick!
(Or press Windows key and type "git bash" then press Enter. After that with command "cd **D:\projects\\**" go to work directory)

After the terminal is open paste command

`git clone git@github.com:borshchcompany/arven.git`

and wait until it's cloned locally. Then you can go to **Arven project** using `cd arven`

You can read more about using git commands in [documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc). It's not easy to understand at first glance but eventually you'll get used to it.

## SSH keys

If you want to `git push` you need to exchange SSH keys.
